
You can create a Windows service in C# by following these steps:

Open Visual Studio and create a new project.

Select the Windows Service template from the Windows Desktop category.

Name your service and click on the Create button.

In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the project and select Add > New
Item.

Select the Service template from the Visual C# Items category.

Name your service and click on the Add button.

In the Service1.cs file, you will see two methods: OnStart and OnStop. The

OnStart method is called when the service starts, and the OnStop method is

called when the service stops. You can add your custom code to these methods

to perform the desired actions.

Build your project by selecting Build > Build Solution from the menu.

Install your service by (in administrator)
sc create "YourServiceName" binPath="c:\.........\YourService.exe"

start your service by
sc start "YourServiceName"

stop your service by
sc stop "YourServiceName"

delete your service by
sc delete "YourServiceName"
